# GitHub Actions Setup Instructions

## Overview

I've created two comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows that meet all your acceptance criteria:

1. **`ci.yml`** - PR validation with testing, linting, and security scanning
2. **`publish.yml`** - Automated NPM publishing with security gates

## Setup Steps

### 1. Move Workflow Files

Since I cannot directly create files in `.github/workflows/`, please move these files:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
mv ci.yml .github/workflows/
mv publish.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 2. Required GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your repository (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):

#### Required Secrets:
- **`NPM_TOKEN`** - Your NPM authentication token with publish permissions
- **`CODECOV_TOKEN`** - Token from Codecov for coverage reporting
- **`SNYK_TOKEN`** - Snyk token for security scanning

#### How to get tokens:

**NPM_TOKEN:**
```bash
npm login
npm token create --type=automation
```

**CODECOV_TOKEN:**
1. Go to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Copy the upload token

**SNYK_TOKEN:**
1. Sign up at [snyk.io](https://snyk.io)
2. Go to Account Settings â†’ General â†’ Auth Token
3. Copy your API token

### 3. Enable Branch Protection (Recommended)

Go to Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Add rule for `main`:
- âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
- âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Select these status checks:
  - `Lint & Format`
  - `Security Scan` 
  - `Build`
  - `Test (ubuntu-latest, 18.x)`
  - `Test (ubuntu-latest, 20.x)`
  - `Coverage Check`
  - `CI Success`

## Acceptance Criteria Verification âœ…

### GitHub Actions workflow for PR validation (test, lint, security scan)
âœ… **Complete** - `ci.yml` includes comprehensive PR validation with:
- ESLint and Prettier checks
- npm audit and Snyk security scanning
- Build verification
- Full test suite across multiple platforms

### Automated testing on Node.js 18.x and 20.x  
âœ… **Complete** - Matrix strategy tests both versions:
```yaml
matrix:
  node-version: ['18.x', '20.x']
```

### Code coverage reporting with Codecov integration
âœ… **Complete** - Coverage uploaded to Codecov with enforced 80% threshold:
```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
```

### Automated npm publishing on main branch merge
âœ… **Complete** - `publish.yml` triggers on main branch pushes with security gates

### Security audit integration (npm audit, Snyk)
âœ… **Complete** - Both workflows include:
- `npm audit --audit-level moderate` (CI)
- `npm audit --audit-level high` (Publish) 
- Snyk security scanning with high severity threshold

### Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
âœ… **Complete** - Matrix strategy includes:
```yaml
matrix:
  os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
```

## TDD Requirements âœ…

### Pipeline fails on test failures
âœ… **Complete** - All jobs have proper failure handling and dependencies

### Coverage requirements enforced (80%+)
âœ… **Complete** - Automated coverage verification blocks deployment:
```javascript
if (total.lines.pct < 80) {
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### Security gates block deployment on vulnerabilities
âœ… **Complete** - Security audits run before publishing and block on high severity issues

## Security Considerations âœ…

### NPM_TOKEN stored securely in GitHub secrets
âœ… **Complete** - Token accessed via `${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}`

### Pipeline permissions follow principle of least privilege
âœ… **Complete** - Minimal permissions specified:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  pull-requests: write
  checks: write
```

### Security scanning integrated into build process
âœ… **Complete** - npm audit and Snyk integrated in both pipelines

## Additional Features

### Provenance and Security
- NPM publishing with `--provenance` flag for supply chain security
- Automated GitHub releases on successful publish
- Post-publish verification to ensure package availability

### Performance and Reliability
- Artifact uploads for build files and test results
- Conditional publishing (skips if version already published)
- Comprehensive error handling and status reporting

### Developer Experience
- Clear job names and status reporting
- Detailed coverage reporting
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Next Steps

1. Move the workflow files to `.github/workflows/`
2. Add the required secrets to your repository
3. Set up branch protection rules (optional but recommended)
4. Create your first PR to test the CI pipeline
5. Merge to main to test the publishing workflow

The workflows are ready to use and will provide comprehensive CI/CD with security-first practices! ðŸš€
