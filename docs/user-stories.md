- Focus: Core validation + basic CLI + security
- Stories: US-001 through US-008, US-021, US-022, US-029, US-033, US-039
- Goal: Basic working validator with secure CLI interface

**Core Features Sprint (Sprint 2 - 2 weeks)**  
- Focus: Live validation + headless mode + error handling
- Stories: US-004, US-005, US-006, US-012, US-013, US-014, US-030
- Goal: Complete basic functionality with automation support

**Advanced Features Sprint (Sprint 3 - 2 weeks)**
- Focus: Plugin system + performance + caching
- Stories: US-016 through US-020, US-025, US-026, US-027, US-034, US-035
- Goal: Extensible architecture with performance optimization

**Polish Sprint (Sprint 4 - 2 weeks)**
- Focus: UX + configuration + documentation
- Stories: US-009 through US-011, US-031, US-032, US-037, US-038, US-040, US-041
- Goal: Production-ready with complete documentation

### Quality Gates

Each story must pass:
1. **TDD Compliance**: Tests written first, 80%+ coverage
2. **Security Review**: No sensitive data exposure
3. **Performance Validation**: Meets response time requirements
4. **Cross-platform Testing**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux
5. **Documentation**: Complete user and developer documentation
6. **Code Review**: Peer review with security focus

### Risk Mitigation

- **API Changes**: Mock all external API calls in tests
- **Security Issues**: Regular security audits and penetration testing
- **Performance Problems**: Continuous performance monitoring and benchmarking
- **Compatibility Issues**: Automated cross-platform testing
- **User Experience Problems**: User testing and feedback loops
