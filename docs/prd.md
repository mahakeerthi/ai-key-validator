# AI Key Validator - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Document Owner:** Product Team

## Product overview

### Product summary

AI Key Validator is a comprehensive npm package designed to validate API keys from major AI providers including OpenAI, Claude/Anthropic, and Gemini/Google. The tool provides both interactive CLI and headless automation modes, enabling developers and DevOps teams to verify API key validity through pattern validation and live API testing while maintaining strict security standards with memory-only operations and zero persistent storage.

## Goals

### Business goals

- Capture 10,000+ weekly npm downloads within 6 months of release
- Establish market leadership in AI API key validation tools
- Generate revenue through enterprise support packages and premium features
- Build strategic partnerships with AI platform providers and DevOps toolchain vendors
- Create a foundation for expanding into broader API management solutions

### User goals

- **Developers**: Quick, reliable validation of AI API keys during development and integration
- **DevOps Teams**: Automated key validation in CI/CD pipelines with standardized exit codes
- **Enterprises**: Secure, audit-compliant key validation without key storage or logging
- **Platform Engineers**: Extensible architecture for adding custom AI provider validations

### Non-goals

- **API key management or storage**: This tool validates only, never stores keys
- **Rate limiting bypass**: Does not attempt to circumvent provider rate limits
- **API key generation**: Does not create or modify API keys
- **Full API client functionality**: Focused solely on validation, not API operations

## User personas

## Narrative

As a developer integrating OpenAI into my application, I need to quickly verify that my API key is valid before deploying to production. I run `npx ai-key-validator`, select OpenAI from the interactive menu, paste my key (which appears masked), and within seconds see a green checkmark confirming my key is active and ready to use. The tool gives me confidence that my integration will work without having to write test code or worry about the key being stored anywhere on my system.
